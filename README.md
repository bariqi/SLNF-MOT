Two Layer Network Flow for Fast Data Association on Multi Object Tracking


in this work we labeling some sequences of data train and test in 2DMOT2015 Dataset.
in the first column is frame and the second column is label for correspondence object.
label 1 for object.
label 0 for non-object.

We label this dataset to distinguish between object and non object, because in the provide dataset there is false detection.
You can use this label for your work, you can train the model using machine learning algorithm, and you can distinguish the rest of object in the sequences.
